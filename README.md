# Before starting
This is my portfolio repository, I will update it as I code more things


## Getting started

This application is made with React JS and MongoDB. In order to see this application, please follow [this link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links).

This repository only contains the source code of the application.
You can find the code [here](https://github.com/TitouanChesneau/Portfolio/tree/master).

## About the application

As I said before, the application is made with React JS and MongoDB. I have already coded some React application, but never used MongoDB. I have to improve on a lot of things before this application is ready.
If you have any questions or tips, feel free to contact me at titouan.chesneau@epitech.eu.
